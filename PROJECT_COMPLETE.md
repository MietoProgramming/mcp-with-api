- Configuration generator for easy Claude Desktop setup
- Complete documentation and setup guides

### Step 3: Consumer Behavior Analysis Tool ✅

- **NEW**: Analytics module with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring
- **NEW**: Predictive reorder probability algorithm
- **NEW**: Churn risk detection
- **NEW**: High-value customer identification
- **NEW**: 5 analytics endpoints + 5 MCP tools

## 📊 Analytics Highlights

### What We Built

The analytics system uses **RFM analysis** - a proven marketing technique that scores consumers on:

1. **Recency**: How recently they purchased (1-5 score)
2. **Frequency**: How often they purchase (1-5 score)
3. **Monetary**: How much they spend (1-5 score)

Combined with purchase pattern analysis to predict:

- **Reorder Probability**: 0-1 score indicating likelihood of next purchase
- **Churn Risk**: High/Medium/Low risk assessment
- **Expected Days Until Next Order**: Based on historical patterns
- **Preferred Categories**: Top 3 product categories

### Example Results

From our test data of 100 consumers:

- **29 high-probability reorders** (>70% chance)
- **71 medium-probability reorders** (40-70% chance)
- **0 low-probability reorders** (<40% chance)
- **Average reorder probability: 70%**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the API

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API runs on: `http://localhost:3000/api`

### 2. Test Analytics

```bash
# Prediction summary
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/summary

# Analyze specific consumer
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/consumer/1

# Churn risk consumers
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/churn-risk

# High-value candidates
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/high-value-candidates
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm run config
```

Copy the output to Claude Desktop config file:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Restart Claude Desktop.

### 4. Try in Claude

```
"Analyze the purchasing behavior of consumer 5"
"Which customers are at risk of not ordering again?"
"Show me high-value customers likely to reorder"
"What's the average reorder probability?"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Customer Retention

```
Query: "Show me consumers at high risk of churning"
Action: Target them with special offers or win-back campaigns
```

### VIP Marketing

```
Query: "Who are the high-value customers likely to buy again?"
Action: Offer premium products or loyalty rewards
```

### Personalized Recommendations

```
Query: "Analyze consumer 42's buying behavior"
Result: See preferred categories (e.g., "Electronics, Gaming, Computers")
Action: Recommend products in those categories
```

### Sales Forecasting

```
Query: "What's the overall reorder probability?"
Result: 70% average reorder probability
Action: Forecast expected revenue from repeat orders
```

## 🧮 The Algorithm

**Reorder Probability Formula:**

```
Probability = (RFM Score / 15 × 0.4) +      # 40% weight
              (Frequency Trend × 0.3) +      # 30% weight
              (Recency Impact × 0.2) +       # 20% weight
              (Order Success Rate × 0.1)     # 10% weight
```

**Churn Risk Assessment:**

- **High Risk**: Last order >90 days ago OR probability <30%
- **Medium Risk**: Last order 60-90 days OR probability 30-50%
- **Low Risk**: Recent orders and high probability

## 💡 Key Insights from Test Data

**Consumer #1 Example:**

- **Name**: Earnest Walsh
- **RFM Score**: 11/15 (High frequency, High monetary, Low recency)
- **Total Orders**: 109
- **Total Spent**: $338,538.88
- **Last Order**: 373 days ago ⚠️
- **Reorder Probability**: 71% (based on historical patterns)
- **Churn Risk**: HIGH (hasn't ordered in over a year!)
- **Insight**: Used to be an excellent customer (ordered every 6 days!) but hasn't ordered recently. **Prime candidate for win-back campaign!**
