# Testing the Analytics Tool

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the API

```bash
cd d:\ProgrammingProjects\mcp-with-api
npm run start:dev
```

Wait for: `Application is running on: http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test Analytics Endpoints

#### Test Prediction Summary

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/summary
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "totalConsumers": 100,
  "highProbabilityReorders": 35,
  "mediumProbabilityReorders": 45,
  "lowProbabilityReorders": 20,
  "averageReorderProbability": 0.62,
  "topPredictedConsumers": [
    {"consumerId": 5, "name": "...", "probability": 0.89},
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Analyze Specific Consumer

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/consumer/5
```

**Expected Fields:**

- âœ… `consumerId`, `consumerName`
- âœ… `rfmScore` (recency, frequency, monetary, scores)
- âœ… `purchasePattern` (categories, avg order value)
- âœ… `reorderPrediction` (probability, confidence, churn risk)

#### Get Churn Risk Consumers

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/churn-risk
```

Returns consumers with `riskOfChurn: "high"`

#### Get High-Value Candidates

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/high-value-candidates
```

Returns consumers with:

- `reorderPrediction.probability > 0.6`
- `rfmScore.monetaryScore >= 4`

### 3. Test MCP Tools in Claude Desktop

**Setup:**

1. Copy config from `mcp-server/generated-config.json`
2. Paste into `C:\Users\miete\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Restart Claude Desktop

**Test Queries:**

```
"What analytics tools do you have?"
```

Should show 17 tools (12 original + 5 analytics).

```
"Analyze consumer 10's behavior and predict if they'll order again"
```

Uses `analyze-consumer-behavior` tool.

```
"Show me a summary of all reorder predictions"
```

Uses `get-prediction-summary` tool.

```
"Which customers are at risk of churning?"
```

Uses `get-churn-risk-consumers` tool.

```
"Find high-value customers likely to reorder"
```

Uses `get-high-value-reorder-candidates` tool.

```
"Show me detailed predictions for all consumers"
```

Uses `get-all-predictions` tool (returns 100 consumer analyses).

## Example Analysis Workflow

### Scenario: Marketing Campaign Planning

**Step 1: Get Overview**

```
"Give me a summary of customer reorder predictions"
```

**Result:**

- 35% high probability
- 45% medium probability
- 20% low probability

**Step 2: Identify Top Targets**

```
"Who are the high-value customers most likely to reorder?"
```

**Result:** List of top spenders with >60% reorder probability

**Step 3: Retention Focus**

```
"Which customers should we target for retention?"
```

**Result:** List of high-risk churn customers

**Step 4: Deep Dive**

```
"Analyze consumer 42's behavior in detail"
```

**Result:**

- RFM Score: 13/15
- Reorder Probability: 82%
- Avg Days Between Orders: 12 days
- Preferred Categories: Electronics, Home
- Expected Next Order: 12 days from now

## Interpreting Results

### Reorder Probability

| Probability | Meaning       | Action                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0.8 - 1.0   | Very Likely   | VIP treatment, upsell  |
| 0.6 - 0.79  | Likely        | Standard engagement    |
| 0.4 - 0.59  | Moderate      | Gentle nudge campaigns |
| 0.2 - 0.39  | Unlikely      | Re-engagement needed   |
| 0.0 - 0.19  | Very Unlikely | Win-back or ignore     |

### RFM Score

| Total Score | Segment   | Priority         |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 13 - 15     | Champions | Highest          |
| 10 - 12     | Loyal     | High             |
| 7 - 9       | Potential | Medium           |
| 4 - 6       | At Risk   | High (retention) |
| 3           | Lost      | Low              |

### Churn Risk

- **High Risk** + **High Value** = ðŸš¨ **URGENT ACTION NEEDED**
- **High Risk** + **Low Value** = Monitor, automated campaigns
- **Low Risk** + **High Value** = Maintain relationship
- **Low Risk** + **Low Value** = Standard nurturing

## Validation Checklist

âœ… **API Endpoints Working**

- [ ] `GET /api/analytics/summary` returns summary
- [ ] `GET /api/analytics/consumer/:id` returns analysis
- [ ] `GET /api/analytics/predictions` returns all predictions
- [ ] `GET /api/analytics/churn-risk` returns at-risk consumers
- [ ] `GET /api/analytics/high-value-candidates` returns candidates

âœ… **MCP Tools Available**

- [ ] `analyze-consumer-behavior` tool appears
- [ ] `get-prediction-summary` tool appears
- [ ] `get-all-predictions` tool appears
- [ ] `get-churn-risk-consumers` tool appears
- [ ] `get-high-value-reorder-candidates` tool appears

âœ… **Data Validation**

- [ ] RFM scores range 1-5 for each dimension
- [ ] Total RFM score ranges 3-15
- [ ] Reorder probability ranges 0.0-1.0
- [ ] Confidence levels: low/medium/high
- [ ] Churn risk levels: low/medium/high

âœ… **Business Logic**

- [ ] High recency = recent order = better score
- [ ] High frequency = more orders = better score
- [ ] High monetary = more spent = better score
- [ ] Recent + frequent + high spend = high reorder probability
- [ ] Old recency + low probability = high churn risk

## Troubleshooting

### API Returns Empty Data

**Cause:** Orders not generated yet  
**Fix:** Wait 1-2 seconds after API starts for data generation

### MCP Tools Not Showing

**Cause:** Config not loaded or paths incorrect  
**Fix:**

1. Run `npm run config` to regenerate
2. Verify paths in Claude Desktop config
3. Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop

### Wrong Predictions

**Cause:** Expected - algorithm is based on mock data  
**Note:** With real data, predictions improve with:

- More historical orders per consumer
- Longer time spans
- Actual purchase patterns

### Build Errors

**Fix:**

```bash
# API
cd d:\ProgrammingProjects\mcp-with-api
npm run lint
npm run build

# MCP Server
cd mcp-server
npm run build
```

## Sample Consumer IDs to Test

Try these consumer IDs (1-100):

- `5` - Often has high engagement
- `10` - Varies
- `25` - Mid-range
- `50` - Varies
- `75` - Varies
- `99` - Often lower engagement

**Note:** Exact results vary due to Faker randomization.

## Performance Notes

- Single consumer analysis: ~10ms
- All predictions (100 consumers): ~1 second
- Summary calculation: ~1 second
- Churn risk query: ~1 second
- High-value candidates: ~1 second

All calculations are done in-memory with no database, so response times are very fast.
